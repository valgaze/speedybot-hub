📚 [API Docs](./api-docs/modules.md)

**What is this:** Experimental branch that ports **[speedybot-hub](https://github.com/valgaze/speedybot-hub)** for use in an AWS Lambda function (rather than serverless+containerless Workers or V8 Isolates)

**[jump to setup](#setup)**
**[jump to issues](#issues)**

The only directory that you need to really think about is **[settings](./settings/)** which houses your handlers & integrations

## Setup

This branch uses **[Serverless Stack (SST)](https://serverless-stack.com/)** toolchain for provisioning, deployment. SST is one of many tools one could use to deploy, but SST has a sepcial **[live-reload editing feature for Lambda functions](https://docs.sst.dev/live-lambda-development)** that will probably be useful for people building conversation experiences.

## 1. Fetch repo & install dependencies

Note: We need to checkout the "lambda" branch below

```
git clone https://github.com/valgaze/speedybot-hub
cd speedybot-hub
git checkout lambda
npm run setup
```

## 2. Set your bot access token

- If you have an existing bot, get its token here: **[https://developer.webex.com/my-apps](https://developer.webex.com/my-apps)**

- If you don't have a bot, create one and save the token from here: **[https://developer.webex.com/my-apps/new/bot](https://developer.webex.com/my-apps/new/bot)**

Once you have the bot's token, save it to **[settings/config.ts](./settings/config.ts)** under the `token` field

## 3. Set up your AWS credentials on your machine

Note: You'll need an AWS account that has authorization/billing to create lambda functions

3a. Setup IAM here: https://sst.dev/chapters/create-an-iam-user.html

3b. Setup AWS CLI: https://sst.dev/chapters/configure-the-aws-cli.html

## 4. Boot your Bot & get its public url

```sh
npm run deploy
```

If deployment is successful, you should your url that looks something like this: https://abcd123456.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

## 4. Register webhooks using Speedybot Garage

In order to receive messages, you'll need to register your agent's URL to receive webhooks for chat.

Try using **[Speedybot bot-garage](https://codepen.io/valgaze/full/MWVjEZV)**, (source available for inspection **[here](https://github.com/valgaze/speedybot-hub/blob/deploy/settings/speedybot_garage.html)**) and select "webhooks" after registering your token

## 4b. (Alternative) Register webhooks using the command line

In a terminal enter the following command:

- Replace t argument with your token
- Replce w argument with your lambda url

```sh
npm init -y speedybot webhook create -- -t _token_here_ -w https://abcd123456.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

Tip: If you're having trouble, you can enter your token & URL step by step by entering `npm init -y speedybot webhook create`

## 5. Take it for a spin

To make sure all is well, add your bot from Step 1 in a 1-1 chat session and tell it "healthcheck"-- if everything is configured properly you should see something like this:

## Issues

### Current issues/bugs 🐞🪲

1. "cold-start" problem

- This is an issue that does not affect Workers/V8 Isolates (see the **[deploy branch](https://github.com/valgaze/speedybot-hub/blob/deploy/quickstart.md)** for an implementation using Workers/V8-Isolates)

- Various solutions available like provisioned concurrency, various tune-ups & tricks

2. Occassional "doubling" problem

- Not consistent: Occassionally a command needs to be sent twice in order to provoke a response from the agent-- unclear why

**Interesting:** If you run the websocket version locally (ie `npm start`) this issue goes away. There is something strange in the network/Lambda/gateway/etc. This is the same toolchain/code powering speedybot-hub which works correctly/performantantly on V8 Isolates/Workers
